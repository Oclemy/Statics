This is a collection of extended descriptions of the Fortran intrinsics
based on the reference document
“[Current F2018 Working Document as of April 2018](http://isotc.iso.org/livelink/livelink?func=ll&objId=19442438&objAction=Open)”.
Vendor-specific extensions are not included.



## Overview


The standard documents and most vendor-supplied descriptions of the
intrinsics are often very brief and concise to the point where the
functionality of the intrinsics becomes obscure, particularly to someone
unfamiliar with the procedure.


By describing the procedures here


these documents strive to clarify the intrinsics for Fortran programmers.


This is a community-driven resource and everyone is encouraged to contribute
to the documents. For contribution guidelines see [minibook guide](https://fortran-lang.org/../../community/minibooks/)
