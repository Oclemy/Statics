Although MATLAB users may find Julia's syntax familiar, Julia is not a MATLAB clone. There are major syntactic and functional differences. The following are some noteworthy differences that may trip up Julia users accustomed to MATLAB:

One of Julia's goals is to provide an effective language for data analysis and statistical programming. For users coming to Julia from R, these are some noteworthy differences:

* Julia's single quotes enclose characters, not strings.
* Julia can create substrings by indexing into strings. In R, strings must be converted into character vectors before creating substrings.
* In Julia, like Python but unlike R, strings can be created with triple quotes `""" ... """`. This syntax is convenient for constructing strings that contain line breaks.
* In Julia, varargs are specified using the splat operator `...`, which always follows the name of a specific variable, unlike R, for which `...` can occur in isolation.
* In Julia, modulus is `mod(a, b)`, not `a %% b`. `%` in Julia is the remainder operator.
* Julia constructs vectors using brackets. Julia's `[1, 2, 3]` is the equivalent of R's `c(1, 2, 3)`.
* In Julia, not all data structures support logical indexing. Furthermore, logical indexing in Julia is supported only with vectors of length equal to the object being indexed. For example:


	+ In R, `c(1, 2, 3, 4)[c(TRUE, FALSE)]` is equivalent to `c(1, 3)`.
	+ In R, `c(1, 2, 3, 4)[c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)]` is equivalent to `c(1, 3)`.
	+ In Julia, `[1, 2, 3, 4][[true, false]]` throws a [`BoundsError`](https://docs.julialang.org/../../base/base/#Core.BoundsError).
	+ In Julia, `[1, 2, 3, 4][[true, false, true, false]]` produces `[1, 3]`.
* Like many languages, Julia does not always allow operations on vectors of different lengths, unlike R where the vectors only need to share a common index range. For example, `c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(1, 2)` is valid R but the equivalent `[1, 2, 3, 4] + [1, 2]` will throw an error in Julia.
* Julia allows an optional trailing comma when that comma does not change the meaning of code. This can cause confusion among R users when indexing into arrays. For example, `x[1,]` in R would return the first row of a matrix; in Julia, however, the comma is ignored, so `x[1,] == x[1]`, and will return the first element. To extract a row, be sure to use `:`, as in `x[1,:]`.
* Julia's [`map`](https://docs.julialang.org/../../base/collections/#Base.map) takes the function first, then its arguments, unlike `lapply(<structure>, function, ...)` in R. Similarly Julia's equivalent of `apply(X, MARGIN, FUN, ...)` in R is [`mapslices`](https://docs.julialang.org/../../base/arrays/#Base.mapslices) where the function is the first argument.
* Multivariate apply in R, e.g. `mapply(choose, 11:13, 1:3)`, can be written as `broadcast(binomial, 11:13, 1:3)` in Julia. Equivalently Julia offers a shorter dot syntax for vectorizing functions `binomial.(11:13, 1:3)`.
* Julia uses `end` to denote the end of conditional blocks, like `if`, loop blocks, like `while`/ `for`, and functions. In lieu of the one-line `if ( cond ) statement`, Julia allows statements of the form `if cond; statement; end`, `cond && statement` and `!cond || statement`. Assignment statements in the latter two syntaxes must be explicitly wrapped in parentheses, e.g. `cond && (x = value)`.
* In Julia, `<-`, `<<-` and `->` are not assignment operators.
* Julia's `->` creates an anonymous function.
* Julia's [`*`](https://docs.julialang.org/../../base/math/#Base.:*-Tuple%7BAny,%20Vararg%7BAny%7D%7D) operator can perform matrix multiplication, unlike in R. If `A` and `B` are matrices, then `A * B` denotes a matrix multiplication in Julia, equivalent to R's `A %*% B`. In R, this same notation would perform an element-wise (Hadamard) product. To get the element-wise multiplication operation, you need to write `A .* B` in Julia.
* Julia performs matrix transposition using the `transpose` function and conjugated transposition using the `'` operator or the `adjoint` function. Julia's `transpose(A)` is therefore equivalent to R's `t(A)`. Additionally a non-recursive transpose in Julia is provided by the `permutedims` function.
* Julia does not require parentheses when writing `if` statements or `for`/`while` loops: use `for i in [1, 2, 3]` instead of `for (i in c(1, 2, 3))` and `if i == 1` instead of `if (i == 1)`.
* Julia does not treat the numbers `0` and `1` as Booleans. You cannot write `if (1)` in Julia, because `if` statements accept only booleans. Instead, you can write `if true`, `if Bool(1)`, or `if 1==1`.
* Julia does not provide `nrow` and `ncol`. Instead, use `size(M, 1)` for `nrow(M)` and `size(M, 2)` for `ncol(M)`.
* Julia is careful to distinguish scalars, vectors and matrices. In R, `1` and `c(1)` are the same. In Julia, they cannot be used interchangeably.
* Julia's [`diag`](https://docs.julialang.org/../../stdlib/LinearAlgebra/#LinearAlgebra.diag) and [`diagm`](https://docs.julialang.org/../../stdlib/LinearAlgebra/#LinearAlgebra.diagm) are not like R's.
* Julia cannot assign to the results of function calls on the left hand side of an assignment operation: you cannot write `diag(M) = fill(1, n)`.
* Julia discourages populating the main namespace with functions. Most statistical functionality for Julia is found in [packages](https://pkg.julialang.org/) under the [JuliaStats organization](https://github.com/JuliaStats). For example:
* Julia provides tuples and real hash tables, but not R-style lists. When returning multiple items, you should typically use a tuple or a named tuple: instead of `list(a = 1, b = 2)`, use `(1, 2)` or `(a=1, b=2)`.
* Julia encourages users to write their own types, which are easier to use than S3 or S4 objects in R. Julia's multiple dispatch system means that `table(x::TypeA)` and `table(x::TypeB)` act like R's `table.TypeA(x)` and `table.TypeB(x)`.
* In Julia, values are not copied when assigned or passed to a function. If a function modifies an array, the changes will be visible in the caller. This is very different from R and allows new functions to operate on large data structures much more efficiently.
* In Julia, vectors and matrices are concatenated using [`hcat`](https://docs.julialang.org/../../base/arrays/#Base.hcat), [`vcat`](https://docs.julialang.org/../../base/arrays/#Base.vcat) and [`hvcat`](https://docs.julialang.org/../../base/arrays/#Base.hvcat), not `c`, `rbind` and `cbind` like in R.
* In Julia, a range like `a:b` is not shorthand for a vector like in R, but is a specialized `AbstractRange` object that is used for iteration. To convert a range into a vector, use [`collect(a:b)`](https://docs.julialang.org/../../base/collections/#Base.collect-Tuple%7BAny%7D).
* The `:` operator has a different precedence in R and Julia. In particular, in Julia arithmetic operators have higher precedence than the `:` operator, whereas the reverse is true in R. For example, `1:n-1` in Julia is equivalent to `1:(n-1)` in R.
* Julia's [`max`](https://docs.julialang.org/../../base/math/#Base.max) and [`min`](https://docs.julialang.org/../../base/math/#Base.min) are the equivalent of `pmax` and `pmin` respectively in R, but both arguments need to have the same dimensions. While [`maximum`](https://docs.julialang.org/../../base/collections/#Base.maximum) and [`minimum`](https://docs.julialang.org/../../base/collections/#Base.minimum) replace `max` and `min` in R, there are important differences.
* Julia's [`sum`](https://docs.julialang.org/../../base/collections/#Base.sum), [`prod`](https://docs.julialang.org/../../base/collections/#Base.prod), [`maximum`](https://docs.julialang.org/../../base/collections/#Base.maximum), and [`minimum`](https://docs.julialang.org/../../base/collections/#Base.minimum) are different from their counterparts in R. They all accept an optional keyword argument `dims`, which indicates the dimensions, over which the operation is carried out. For instance, let `A = [1 2; 3 4]` in Julia and `B <- rbind(c(1,2),c(3,4))` be the same matrix in R. Then `sum(A)` gives the same result as `sum(B)`, but `sum(A, dims=1)` is a row vector containing the sum over each column and `sum(A, dims=2)` is a column vector containing the sum over each row. This contrasts to the behavior of R, where separate `colSums(B)` and `rowSums(B)` functions provide these functionalities. If the `dims` keyword argument is a vector, then it specifies all the dimensions over which the sum is performed, while retaining the dimensions of the summed array, e.g. `sum(A, dims=(1,2)) == hcat(10)`. It should be noted that there is no error checking regarding the second argument.
* Julia has several functions that can mutate their arguments. For example, it has both [`sort`](https://docs.julialang.org/../../base/sort/#Base.sort) and [`sort!`](https://docs.julialang.org/../../base/sort/#Base.sort!).
* In R, performance requires vectorization. In Julia, almost the opposite is true: the best performing code is often achieved by using devectorized loops.
* Julia is eagerly evaluated and does not support R-style lazy evaluation. For most users, this means that there are very few unquoted expressions or column names.
* Julia does not support the `NULL` type. The closest equivalent is [`nothing`](https://docs.julialang.org/../../base/constants/#Core.nothing), but it behaves like a scalar value rather than like a list. Use `x === nothing` instead of `is.null(x)`.
* In Julia, missing values are represented by the [`missing`](https://docs.julialang.org/../../base/base/#Base.missing) object rather than by `NA`. Use [`ismissing(x)`](https://docs.julialang.org/../../base/base/#Base.ismissing) (or `ismissing.(x)` for element-wise operation on vectors) instead of `is.na(x)`. The [`skipmissing`](https://docs.julialang.org/../../base/base/#Base.skipmissing) function is generally used instead of `na.rm=TRUE` (though in some particular cases functions take a `skipmissing` argument).
* Julia lacks the equivalent of R's `assign` or `get`.
* In Julia, `return` does not require parentheses.
* In R, an idiomatic way to remove unwanted values is to use logical indexing, like in the expression `x[x>3]` or in the statement `x = x[x>3]` to modify `x` in-place. In contrast, Julia provides the higher order functions [`filter`](https://docs.julialang.org/../../base/collections/#Base.filter) and [`filter!`](https://docs.julialang.org/../../base/collections/#Base.filter!), allowing users to write `filter(z->z>3, x)` and `filter!(z->z>3, x)` as alternatives to the corresponding transliterations `x[x.>3]` and `x = x[x.>3]`. Using [`filter!`](https://docs.julialang.org/../../base/collections/#Base.filter!) reduces the use of temporary arrays.
