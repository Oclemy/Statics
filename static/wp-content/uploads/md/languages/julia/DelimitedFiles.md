```julia
readdlm(source, delim::AbstractChar, T::Type, eol::AbstractChar; header=false, skipstart=0, skipblanks=true, use_mmap, quotes=true, dims, comments=false, comment_char='#')
```
Read a matrix from the source where each line (separated by `eol`) gives one row, with elements separated by the given delimiter. The source can be a text file, stream or byte array. Memory mapped files can be used by passing the byte array representation of the mapped segment as source.

If `T` is a numeric type, the result is an array of that type, with any non-numeric elements as `NaN` for floating-point types, or zero. Other useful values of `T` include `String`, `AbstractString`, and `Any`.

If `header` is `true`, the first row of data will be read as header and the tuple `(data_cells, header_cells)` is returned instead of only `data_cells`.

Specifying `skipstart` will ignore the corresponding number of initial lines from the input.

If `skipblanks` is `true`, blank lines in the input will be ignored.

If `use_mmap` is `true`, the file specified by `source` is memory mapped for potential speedups if the file is large. Default is `false`. On a Windows filesystem, `use_mmap` should not be set to `true` unless the file is only read once and is also not written to. Some edge cases exist where an OS is Unix-like but the filesystem is Windows-like.

If `quotes` is `true`, columns enclosed within double-quote (") characters are allowed to contain new lines and column delimiters. Double-quote characters within a quoted field must be escaped with another double-quote. Specifying `dims` as a tuple of the expected rows and columns (including header, if any) may speed up reading of large files. If `comments` is `true`, lines beginning with `comment_char` and text following `comment_char` in any line are ignored.

**Examples**


```julia
julia> using DelimitedFiles

julia> x = [1; 2; 3; 4];

julia> y = [5; 6; 7; 8];

julia> open("delim_file.txt", "w") do io
           writedlm(io, [x y])
       end

julia> readdlm("delim_file.txt", 't', Int, 'n')
4Ã—2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  5
 2  6
 3  7
 4  8

julia> rm("delim_file.txt")
```
