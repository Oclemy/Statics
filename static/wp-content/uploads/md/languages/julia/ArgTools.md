```julia
arg_writers([ type = ArgWrite ]) do path::String, arg::Function
    ## pre-test setup ##
    @arg_test arg begin
        arg :: ArgWrite
        ## test using `arg` ##
    end
    ## post-test cleanup ##
end
```
The `arg_writers` function takes a do block, which is invoked once for each test writer type that `arg_write` can handle with a temporary (non-existent) `path` and `arg` which can be converted into various writable argument types which write to `path`. If the optional `type` argument is given then the do block is only invoked for writers that produce arguments of that type.

The `arg` passed to the do block is not the argument value itself, because some of test argument types need to be initialized and finalized for each test case. Consider an open file handle argument: once you've used it for one test, you can't use it again; you need to close it and open the file again for the next test. This function `arg` can be converted into an `ArgWrite` instance using `@arg_test arg begin ... end`.

There is also an `arg_writers` method that takes a path name like `arg_readers`:


```julia
arg_writers(path::AbstractString, [ type = ArgWrite ]) do arg::Function
    ## pre-test setup ##
    @arg_test arg begin
        # here `arg :: ArgWrite`
        ## test using `arg` ##
    end
    ## post-test cleanup ##
end
```
This method is useful if you need to specify `path` instead of using path name generated by `tempname()`. Since `path` is passed from outside of `arg_writers`, the path is not an argument to the do block in this form.
