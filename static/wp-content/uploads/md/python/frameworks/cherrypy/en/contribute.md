## Filing Bug Reports

expect, you may file a bug report at [the project page](https://github.com/cherrypy/cherrypy). Be sure to include
what your expectation was, what happened instead, details about
your system that might be relevant, and steps that someone else
could take to replicate your finding. The more detailed and exact

## Fixing Bugs


CherryPy has a number of open, reported [issues](https://github.com/cherrypy/cherrypy/issues). Some of them are
complicated and difficult, but others are more straightforward and
shovel-ready. Feel free to find one that you think you can solve or
introduce yourself and ask for guidance in [our gitter channel](https://gitter.im/cherrypy/cherrypy).


As you work through the issue and commit changes to your clone
of the repository, be sure to add issue references to your changes
(like âFixes #999â or âRef #999â) so your changes link to the
issue and vice-versa.
