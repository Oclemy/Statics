# Advanced User Guide


## Additional Features


The main Tutorial - User Guide should be enough to give you a tour through all the main features of **FastAPI**.


In the next sections you will see other options, configurations, and additional features.



Tip


The next sections are **not necessarily "advanced"**.


And it's possible that for your use case, the solution is in one of them.



## Read the Tutorial first


You could still use most of the features in **FastAPI** with the knowledge from the main Tutorial - User Guide.


And the next sections assume you already read it, and assume that you know those main ideas.


## TestDriven.io course


If you would like to take an advanced-beginner course to complement this section of the docs, you might want to check: Test-Driven Development with FastAPI and Docker by **TestDriven.io**.


They are currently donating 10% of all profits to the development of **FastAPI**. ðŸŽ‰ ðŸ˜„
