# Add capabilities

Capabilities in `shortcuts.xml` allow you to declare the types of actions users can take to launch your app and jump directly to performing a specific task. For example, Google Assistant App Actions use capabilities to enable developers to extend in-app features to built-in intents (BII), allowing users to activate and control those features using spoken commands. A capability consists of the name of the action and an `intent` targeting the destination in your app that resolves the user intent.

Define capabilities in shortcuts.xml
------------------------------------

You define `capability` elements in a `shortcuts.xml` resource file in your Android app development project. To define a `capability` element:

1.  Create a `shortcuts.xml` resource by following the instructions in Create static shortcuts.
2.  Next, include the following required information in your capability:
    
    *   **Capability name**: The action you want your app to support. Refer to the component documentation for the feature that requires capability definitions. App Actions voice-enabled commands use the BII `Action ID` for capability names, which are located in Built-in intents reference. For instance, the `GET_THING` BII lists its `Action ID` as `actions.intent.GET_THING`.
        
    *   **App destination**: The destination in your app the action launches to fulfill the user request. Define app destinations using `intent` elements nested within the `capability`.
        
    *   **Parameter mappings**: Each `intent` may contain parameters to be passed as `extra` data of the intent. For example, each App Actions BII includes fields representing information users often provide in queries that trigger the BII.
        

The following example demonstrates a capability definition in `shortcuts.xml` for `actions.intent.START_EXERCISE`, a BII that enables users to use spoken commands with Assistant to begin a workout in a fitness app:

```xml
    <shortcuts xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
      <capability android:name="actions.intent.START_EXERCISE">
        <intent
          android:action="android.intent.action.VIEW"
          android:targetPackage="com.example.sampleApp"
          android:targetClass="com.example.sampleApp.ExerciseActivity">
          <parameter
            android:name="exercise.name"
            android:key="exerciseType"/>
        </intent>
      </capability>
    </shortcuts>
  ```

In the preceding example, the `<capability>` `android:name` attribute refers to the `START_EXERCISE` BII. If a user invokes this BII by asking Assistant, _"Hey Google, start a run in ExampleApp,"_ Assistant fulfills the user request using information provided in the nested `intent` element. The `intent` in this sample defines the following details:

*   The `android:targetPackage` sets the target application package for this intent.
*   The `android:targetClass` field specifies the destination activity: `com.example.sampleApp.ExerciseActivity`.
*   The intent `parameter` declares support for a built-in intent parameter `exercise.name`, and how to pass the parameter value, collected from the user, as extra data in the `intent`.

Associate shortcuts with a capability
-------------------------------------

Once you have defined a capability, you can extend its functionality by associating static or dynamic shortcuts with it. How shortcuts are linked to a `capability` depends on the feature being implemented and the actual words included in a user's request. For example, imagine a scenario where a user begins a run in your fitness tracking app by asking Assistant, _â€œHey Google, start a run in ExampleApp."_ Assistant could use a shortcut to launch an instance of a `capability` that defines a valid exercise entity of "run" for the `exercise.name` parameter.
