# Overview

Users rely on their mobile devices for virtually everything these days, from sending emails and managing finances, to streaming videos and streaming and playing video games. In order to be useful, most apps require data, images, and other media from remote services. It’s important to remember that your app is just one of many apps on the user’s device, all competing for network resources. Managed poorly, this can have a dramatic and detrimental impact on battery performance and unnecessarily use the user’s limited network bandwidth.

Starting with Android 8.0, several updates were introduced to the OS which help preserve battery, user experience, and system health. However, there are additional considerations, strategies, and patterns that you as a developer can employ yourself, as well. Requests that your app makes to the network can be a major cause of battery drain because they rely on the heavily power-consuming cellular and Wi-Fi radios.

In this guide, you’ll learn about the following:

*   How your app’s connectivity model interacts with the wireless radio state machine.
*   How to employ techniques for minimizing the impact of your data connection.
*   How to troubleshoot slow connections.
*   How to run background work only under specific conditions such as when the device is charging or on Wi-Fi.
*   How to track your app’s battery usage over time.

Finally, you’ll learn about three broad categories of updates: User-initiated, App-initiated, and Server-initiated, with tools and techniques for maximizing the efficiency of each category.

Ultimately, it’s all of our responsibilities as a developer community to provide the best app experience for our users.
