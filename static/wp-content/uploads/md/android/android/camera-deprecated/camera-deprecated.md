# Camera

> **Note:** This page refers to the Camera class, which is deprecated. We recommend using CameraX or, for specific use cases, Camera2. Both CameraX and Camera2 support Android 5.0 (API level 21) and higher.

Android provides full access to the device camera hardware so you can build a wide range of camera or vision-based apps. Or if you just need a way for the user to capture a photo, you can simply request an existing camera app to capture a photo and return it to you.
