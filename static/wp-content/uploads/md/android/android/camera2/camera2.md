# Camera2 overview

> **Note:** This page refers to the Camera2 package. Unless your app requires specific, low-level features from Camera2, we recommend using CameraX. Both CameraX and Camera2 support Android 5.0 (API level 21) and higher.

Camera2 is the latest low-level Android camera package and replaces the deprecated Camera class. Camera2 provides in-depth controls for complex use cases, but requires you to manage device-specific configurations. You can read about specific Camera2 classes and functions in the reference documentation.

For most developers, we recommend the CameraX Jetpack library. For more information, see Choose a camera library.
