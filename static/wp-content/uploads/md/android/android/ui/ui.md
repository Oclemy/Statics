# Develop UI for Android

![](https://developer.android.com/images/cluster-illustrations/ui-for-android.svg)

To create new UIs, we recommend using Compose, Android's declarative UI toolkit. Google designed Compose to simplify and accelerate UI development, so you can use less code, more-powerful tools, and intuitive Kotlin APIs.

For existing Views-based UIs, you can choose to migrate to Compose or continue to use Views-based workflows.

Both frameworks offer pre-built UI components that work with graphics, animations, and other visual elements.
