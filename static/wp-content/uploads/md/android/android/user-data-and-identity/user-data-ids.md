# Best practices for unique identifiers

This document provides guidance for selecting appropriate identifiers for your app based on your use case.

For a general look at Android permissions, see Permissions overview. For specific best practices for working with Android permissions, see App permissions best practices.

Best practices for working with Android identifiers
---------------------------------------------------

To protect the privacy of your users, use the most restrictive identifier that satisfies your app's use case. In particular, follow these best practices:

1.  _**Choose user-resettable identifiers whenever possible.**_ Your app can achieve most of its use cases even when it uses identifiers other than non-resettable hardware IDs.
2.  _**Avoid using hardware identifiers.**_ In most use cases, you can avoid using hardware identifiers, such as International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI), without limiting required functionality.
    
    AndroidÂ 10 (API level 29) adds restrictions for non-resettable identifiers, which include both IMEI and serial number. Your app must be a device or profile owner app, have special carrier permissions, or have the `READ_PRIVILEGED_PHONE_STATE` privileged permission in order to access these identifiers.
    
3.  _**Only use an Advertising ID for user profiling or ads use cases.**_ When using an Advertising ID, always respect users' selections regarding ad tracking. If you must connect the advertising identifier to personally-identifiable information, do so only with the explicit consent of the user.
    
4.  _**Don't bridge Advertising ID resets.**_
    
5.  _**Use a Firebase installation ID (FID) or a privately stored GUID whenever possible for all other use cases, except for payment fraud prevention and telephony.**_ For the vast majority of non-ads use cases, an FID or GUID should be sufficient.
    
6.  _**Use APIs that are appropriate for your use case to minimize privacy risk.**_ Use the DRM API for high-value content protection and the SafetyNet APIs for abuse protection. The SafetyNet APIs are the easiest way to determine whether a device is genuine without incurring privacy risk.
    

The remaining sections of this guide elaborate on these rules in the context of developing Android apps.

Work with advertising IDs
-------------------------

The Advertising ID is a user-resettable identifier and is appropriate for ads use cases. There are some key points to bear in mind, however, when you use this ID:

_**Always respect the user's intention in resetting the advertising ID.**_ Don't bridge user resets by using another identifier or fingerprint to link subsequent Advertising IDs together without the user's consent. The Google Play Developer Content Policy states the following:

> _"...if reset, a new advertising identifier must not be connected to a previous advertising identifier or data derived from a previous advertising identifier without the explicit consent of the user."_

_**Always respect the associated Personalized Ads flag.**_ Advertising IDs are configurable in that users can limit the amount of tracking associated with the ID. Always use the `AdvertisingIdClient.Info.isLimitAdTrackingEnabled()`) method to ensure that you aren't circumventing your users' wishes. The Google Play Developer Content Policy states the following:

> _"...you must abide by a user's 'Opt out of interest-based advertising' or 'Opt out of Ads Personalization' setting. If a user has enabled this setting, you may not use the advertising identifier for creating user profiles for advertising purposes or for targeting users with personalized advertising. Allowed activities include contextual advertising, frequency capping, conversion tracking, reporting and security and fraud detection."_

_**Be aware of any privacy or security policies associated with SDKs you use that are related to Advertising ID use.**_ For example, if you pass `true` into the `enableAdvertisingIdCollection()`) method from the Google Analytics SDK, make sure to review and adhere to all applicable Analytics SDK policies.

Also, be aware that the Google Play Developer Content Policy requires that the Advertising ID "must not be connected to personally-identifiable information or associated with any persistent device identifier (for example: SSAID, MAC address, IMEI, etc.,)."

As an example, suppose you want to collect information to populate database tables with the following columns:

TABLE-01

`timestamp`

`ad_id`

`account_id`

`clickid`

TABLE-02

`account_id`

`name`

`dob`

`country`

In this example, the `ad_id` column could be joined to PII via the `account_id` column in both tables, which would be a violation of the Google Play Developer Content Policy, if you didn't get explicit permission from your users.

Keep in mind that links between Advertiser ID and PII aren't always this explicit. It's possible to have "quasi-identifiers" that appear in both PII and Ad ID keyed tables, which also cause problems. For example, assume we change TABLE-01 and TABLE-02 as follows:

TABLE-01

`timestamp`

`ad_id`

`clickid`

`dev_model`

TABLE-02

`timestamp`

`demo`

`account_id`

`dev_model`

`name`

In this case, with sufficiently rare click events, it's still possible to join between the Advertiser ID TABLE-01 and the PII contained in TABLE-02 using the timestamp of the event and the device model.

Although it's often difficult to guarantee that no such quasi-identifiers exist in a dataset, you can prevent the most obvious join risks by generalizing unique data where possible. In the preceding example, this would mean reducing the accuracy of the timestamp so that multiple devices with the same model appear for every timestamp.

Other solutions include the following:

*   _**Not designing tables that explicitly link PII with Advertising IDs**_. In the first example above, this would mean not including the `account_id` column in TABLE-01.
    
*   _**Segregating and monitoring access control lists for users or roles that have access to both the Advertising ID keyed data and PII**_. By tightly controlling and auditing the ability to access both sources simultaneously (for example, by performing a join between tables), you reduce the risk of association between the Advertising ID and PII. Generally speaking, controlling access means doing the following:
    
    1.  Keep access control lists (ACLs) for Advertiser ID keyed data and PII disjoint to minimize the number of individuals or roles that are in both ACLs.
    2.  Implement access logging and auditing to detect and manage any exceptions to this rule.

For more information on working responsibly with Advertising IDs, see the `AdvertisingIdClient` API reference.

Work with FIDs and GUIDs
------------------------

The most straightforward solution to identifying an app instance running on a device is to use a Firebase installation ID (FID), and this is the recommended solution in the majority of non-ads use cases. Only the app instance for which it was provisioned can access this identifier, and it's (relatively) easily resettable because it only persists as long as the app is installed.

As a result, FIDs provide better privacy properties compared to non-resettable, device-scoped hardware IDs. For more information, see the `firebase.installations` API reference.

In cases where an FID isn't practical, you can also use custom globally-unique IDs (GUIDs) to uniquely identify an app instance. The simplest way to do so is by generating your own GUID using the following code:

### Kotlin

```kotlin
var uniqueID = UUID.randomUUID().toString()
```

### Java

```java
String uniqueID = UUID.randomUUID().toString();
```

Because the identifier is globally unique, it can be used to identify a specific app instance. To avoid concerns related to linking the identifier across apps, store GUIDs in internal storage instead of external (shared) storage. For more information, see the Data and file storage overview page.

Don't work with MAC addresses
-----------------------------

MAC addresses are globally unique, not user-resettable, and survive factory resets. For these reasons, to protect user privacy, on Android versions 6 and higher, access to MAC addresses is restricted to system apps. Third-party apps can't access them.

### MAC address availability changes in Android 11

On apps targeting Android 11 and higher, MAC randomization for Passpoint networks is per Passpoint profile, generating a unique MAC address based on the following fields:

*   Fully-qualified domain name (FQDN)
*   Realm
*   Credential, based on the credential used in the Passpoint profile:
    *   User credential: user name
    *   Certificate credential: cert and cert type
    *   SIM credential: EAP type and IMSI

In addition, non-privileged apps can't access the device's MAC address; only network interfaces with an IP address are visible. This impacts the `getifaddrs()` and `NetworkInterface.getHardwareAddress()`) methods, as well as sending `RTM_GETLINK` Netlink messages.

The following is a list of the ways that apps are affected by this change:

*   `NetworkInterface.getHardwareAddress()` returns null for every interface.
*   Apps cannot use the `bind()` function on `NETLINK_ROUTE` sockets.
*   The `ip` command does not return information about interfaces.
*   Apps cannot send `RTM_GETLINK` messages.

Note that most developers should use the higher-level APIs of `ConnectivityManager` rather than lower-level APIs like `NetworkInterface`, `getifaddrs()`, or Netlink sockets. For example, an app that needs up-to-date information on the current routes can get this information by listening for network changes using `ConnectivityManager.registerNetworkCallback()`) and calling the network's associated `LinkProperties.getRoutes()`).

Identifier characteristics
--------------------------

The Android OS offers a number of IDs with different behavior characteristics. Which ID you should use depends on how the following characteristics work with your use case. These characteristics also come with privacy implications, however, so it's important to understand how these characteristics interact with each other.

### Scope

Identifier scope explains which systems can access the identifier. Android identifier scope generally comes in three flavors:

*   _Single app_: The ID is internal to the app and not accessible to other apps.
*   _Group of apps_: The ID is accessible to a pre-defined group of related apps.
*   _Device_: The ID is accessible to all apps installed on the device.

The wider the scope granted to an identifier, the greater the risk of it being used for tracking purposes. Conversely, if an identifier can only be accessed by a single app instance, it cannot be used to track a device across transactions in different apps.

### Resettability and persistence

Resettability and persistence define the lifespan of the identifier and explain how it can be reset. Common reset triggers include: in-app resets, resets via System Settings, resets on launch, and resets on installation. Android identifiers can have varying lifespans, but the lifespan is usually related to how the ID is reset:

*   _Session-only_: A new ID is used every time the user restarts the app.
*   _Install-reset_: A new ID is used every time user uninstalls and reinstalls the app.
*   _FDR-reset_: A new ID is used every time the user factory-resets the device.
*   _FDR-persistent_: The ID survives factory reset.

Resettability gives users the ability to create a new ID that is disassociated from any existing profile information. The longer, and more reliably, an identifier persists, such as one that persists across factory resets, the greater the risk that the user may be subjected to long-term tracking. If the identifier is reset upon app reinstall, this reduces the persistence and provides a means for the ID to be reset, even if there is no explicit user control to reset it from within the app or System Settings.

### Uniqueness

Uniqueness establishes the likelihood of collisions; that is, that identical identifiers exist within the associated scope. At the highest level, a globally unique identifier never has a collision, even on other devices or apps. Otherwise, the level of uniqueness depends on the entropy of the identifier and the source of randomness used to create it. For example, the chance of a collision is much higher for random identifiers seeded with the calendar date of installation (such as `2019-03-01`) than for identifiers seeded with the Unix timestamp of installation (such as `1551414181`).

In general, user account identifiers can be considered unique. That is, each device/account combination has a unique ID. On the other hand, the less unique an identifier is within a population, the greater the privacy protection because it's less useful for tracking an individual user.

### Integrity protection and non-repudiability

You can use an identifier that is difficult to spoof or replay to prove that the associated device or account has certain properties. For example, you could prove that the device isn't a virtual device used by a spammer. Difficult-to-spoof identifiers also provide _non-repudiability_. If the device signs a message with a secret key, it's difficult to claim that someone else's device sent the message. Non-repudiability could be something a user wants, such as when authenticating a payment, or it could be an undesirable property, such as when they send a message they regret.

Common use cases and the appropriate identifier to use
------------------------------------------------------

This section provides alternatives to using hardware IDs, such as IMEI. Using hardware IDs is discouraged because the user cannot reset them, and they're scoped to the device. In many cases, an app-scoped identifier would suffice.

### Accounts

#### Carrier status

_In this case, your app interacts with the device's phone and texting functionality using a carrier account._

**Recommended identifier to use:** IMEI, IMSI, and Line1

**Why this recommendation?**

Leveraging hardware identifiers is acceptable if it's required for carrier-related functionality. For example, you could use these identifiers to switch between cellular carriers or SIM slots, or to deliver SMS messages over IP (for Line1) - SIM-based user accounts. For unprivileged apps, however, we recommend using an account sign-in to retrieve user device information server-side. One reason for this is that, in Android 6.0 (API level 23) and higher, these identifiers can only be used via a runtime permission. Users might toggle off this permission, so your app should handle these exceptions gracefully.

#### Mobile subscription status

_In this case, you need to associate app functionality with certain mobile service subscriptions on the device. For example, you may have a requirement to verify access to certain premium app features based on the device's mobile subscriptions via SIM._

**Recommended identifier to use:** Subscription ID API) to identify SIMs that are used on the device.

The Subscription ID provides an index value (starting at 1) for uniquely identifying installed SIMs (including physical and electronic) used on the device. Through this ID, your app can associate its functionality with various subscription information for a given SIM. This value is stable for a given SIM unless the device is factory reset. However, there may be cases where the same SIM has a different Subscription ID on different devices or different SIMs have the same ID on different devices.

**Why this recommendation?**

Some apps may be currently using the ICC ID for this purpose. Because the ICC ID is globally unique and non-resettable, the access has been restricted to apps with the `READ_PRIVILEGED_PHONE_STATE` permission since Android 10. Beginning with Android 11, Android further restricted access to the ICCID through the `getIccId()` API, regardless of the app's target API level. Affected apps should migrate to use the Subscription ID instead.

#### Single sign-on

_In this case, your app offers a single sign-on experience, allowing users to associate an existing account with your organization._

**Recommended identifier to use:** Account manager-compatible accounts, such as Google Account Linking

**Why this recommendation?**

Google Account Linking allows users to associate a user's existing Google account with your app, providing seamless and more secure access to your organization's products and services. Additionally, you can define custom OAuth scopes to share only necessary data, increasing user trust by clearly defining how their data is used.

### Ads

#### Targeting

_In this case, your app builds a profile of a user's interests, to show them more relevant ads._

**Recommended identifier to use:** If your app uses an ID for ads and uploads or publishes to Google Play, that ID must be the Advertising ID.

**Why this recommendation?**

This is an ads-related use case which might require an ID that is available across your organization's different apps, so using an Advertising ID is the most appropriate solution. Use of the Advertising ID is mandatory for advertising use cases, per the Google Play Developer Content Policy, because the user can reset it.

Regardless of whether you share user data in your app, if you collect and use it for ads purposes, you need to declare the ads purposes in the Data safety section of the **App content** page in the Play Console.

#### Measurement

_In this case, your app creates a profile of a user based on their behavior across your organization's apps on the same device._

**Recommended identifier to use:** Advertising ID or Play install referrer APIs

**Why this recommendation?**

This is an ads-related use case which might require an ID that is available across your organization's different apps, so using an Advertising ID is the most appropriate solution. If you use an ID for advertising use cases, that ID must be the Advertising ID because the user can reset it. Learn more in the Google Play Developer Content Policy.

#### Conversions

_In this case, you're tracking conversions to detect if your marketing strategy is successful._

**Recommended identifier to use:** Advertising ID or Play install referrer APIs

**Why this recommendation?**

This is an ads-related use case which might require an ID that is available across your organization's different apps, so using an Advertising ID is the most appropriate solution. Use of the Advertising ID is mandatory for advertising use cases, per the Google Play Developer Content Policy, because the user can reset it.

_In this case, your app shows ads based on a user's previous interests._

**Recommended identifier to use:** Advertising ID

**Why this recommendation?**

This is an ads-related use case which might require an ID that is available across your organization's different apps, so using an Advertising ID is the most appropriate solution. Use of the Advertising ID is mandatory for advertising use cases, per the Google Play Developer Content Policy, because the user can reset it.

### App analytics

_In this case, your app evaluates a user's behavior to help you determine the following:_

*   _Which of your organization's other products or apps might be suitable for the user._
*   _How to keep users interested in using your app._
*   _Measure usage statistics and analytics for signed-out or anonymous users._

Possible solutions include:

*   **App set ID:** An App Set ID allows you to analyze a user's behavior across multiple apps that your organization owns, as long as you don't use user data for advertising purposes. If you're targeting devices powered by Google Play services, we recommend that you use App Set ID.
*   **Firebase ID (FID):** An FID is scoped to the app that creates it, which prevents the identifier from being used to track users across apps. It is also easily resettable, as the user can clear app data or reinstall the app. The process of creating a FID is straightforward; see the Firebase installations guide.

### App development

#### Crash reporting

_In this case, your app collects data regarding when and why it crashes on a user's devices._

**Recommended identifier to use:** FID or App set ID

**Why this recommendation?**

An FID is scoped to the app that creates it, which prevents the identifier from being used to track users across apps. It is also easily resettable, as the user can clear app data or reinstall the app. The process of creating a FID is straightforward; see the Firebase installations guide. An App Set ID allows you to analyze a user's behavior across multiple apps that your organization owns, as long as you don't use user data for advertising purposes.

#### Performance reporting

In this case, your app collects performance metrics, such as load times and battery usage, to help improve your app's quality.

**Recommended identifier to use:** Firebase Performance Monitoring

**Why this recommendation?**

Firebase Performance Monitoring helps you focus on the metrics that matter most to you, and to test the impact of a recent change in your app.

### App testing

In this case, your app evaluates a user's experience with your app for testing or debugging purposes.

**Recommended identifier to use:** FID or App set ID

**Why this recommendation?**

An FID is scoped to the app that creates it, which prevents the identifier from being used to track users across apps. It is also easily resettable, as the user can clear app data or reinstall the app. The process of creating a FID is straightforward; see the Firebase installations guide. An App Set ID allows you to analyze a user's behavior across multiple apps that your organization owns, as long as you don't use user data for advertising purposes.

### Cross-device installation

_In this case, your app needs to identify the correct instance of the app when it's installed on multiple devices for the same user._

**Recommended identifier to use:** FID or GUID

**Why this recommendation?**

An FID is designed explicitly for this purpose; its scope is limited to the app so that it cannot be used to track users across different apps, and it's reset upon app reinstall. In the rare cases where an FID is insufficient, you can also use a GUID.

### Security

#### Abuse detection

_In this case, you are trying to detect multiple fake devices attacking your backend services._

**Recommended identifier to use:** The SafetyNet API

**Why this recommendation?**

An identifier in isolation does little to indicate that a device is genuine. You can verify that a request comes from a genuine Android deviceâas opposed to an emulator or other code spoofing another deviceâusing the SafetyNet API's `attest()`) method to verify the integrity of a device making a request. For more detailed information, see the SafetyNet API documentation.

#### Ad fraud

_In this case, your app checks that a user's impressions and actions in your app are genuine and verifiable._

**Recommended identifier to use:** Advertising ID

**Why this recommendation?**

Use of the Advertising ID is mandatory for advertising use cases, per the Google Play Developer Content Policy, because the user can reset it.

#### Digital rights management (DRM)

_In this case, your app wants to protect fraudulent access to intellectual property or paid content._

**Recommended identifier to use:** Using an FID or GUID forces the user to reinstall the app in order to circumvent the content limits, which is a sufficient burden to deter most people. If this isn't sufficient protection, Android provides a DRM API, which can be used to limit access to content, includes a per-APK identifier, the Widevine ID.

### User preferences

_In this case, your app saves per-device user state on your app's, particularly for users who aren't signed in. You might transfer this state to another app that's signed with the same key on the same device._

**Recommended identifier to use:** FID or GUID

**Why this recommendation?**

Persisting information through reinstalls isn't recommended because users may want to reset their preferences by reinstalling the app.
