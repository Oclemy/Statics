# Nested navigation graphs

A series of destinations can be grouped into a _nested graph_ within a parent navigation graph called the _root graph_. Nested graphs are useful to organize and reuse sections of your appâ€™s UI, such as a self-contained login flow.

The nested graph encapsulates its destinations. As with a root graph, a nested graph must have a destination identified as the start destination. Destinations outside of the nested graph, such as those on the root graph, access the nested graph only through its start destination.

Figure 1 shows a navigation graph for a simple money transfer app. From the start destination on the left, the graph has two flows: one along the top for sending money and another along the bottom for viewing an account balance.

To group destinations into a nested graph, do the following:

1.  In the Navigation Editor, press and hold the **Shift** key, and click on the destinations you want to include in the nested graph.
2.  Right-click to open the context menu, and select **Move to Nested Graph** > **New Graph**. The destinations are enclosed in a nested graph. Figure 2 shows a nested graph in the **Navigation Editor**:

3.  Click on the nested graph. The following attributes appear in the **Attributes** panel:
    
    *   **Type**, which contains "Nested Graph"
    *   **ID**, which contains a system-assigned ID for the nested graph. This ID is used to reference the nested graph from your code.
4.  Double-click on the nested graph to show its destinations.
    
5.  Click the **Text** tab to toggle to the XML view. A nested navigation graph has been added to the graph. This navigation graph has its own `navigation` elements, along with its own ID and a `startDestination` attribute that points to the first destination in the nested graph:
    
```xml
        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
        <navigation xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
            xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
            xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
            app:startDestination="@id/mainFragment">
            <fragment
                android:id="@+id/mainFragment"
                android:name="com.example.cashdog.cashdog.MainFragment"
                android:label="fragment_main"
                tools:layout="@layout/fragment_main" >
                <action
                    android:id="@+id/action_mainFragment_to_sendMoneyGraph"
                    app:destination="@id/sendMoneyGraph" />
                <action
                    android:id="@+id/action_mainFragment_to_viewBalanceFragment"
                    app:destination="@id/viewBalanceFragment" />
            </fragment>
            <fragment
                android:id="@+id/viewBalanceFragment"
                android:name="com.example.cashdog.cashdog.ViewBalanceFragment"
                android:label="fragment_view_balance"
                tools:layout="@layout/fragment_view_balance" />
            <navigation android:id="@+id/sendMoneyGraph" app:startDestination="@id/chooseRecipient">
                <fragment
                    android:id="@+id/chooseRecipient"
                    android:name="com.example.cashdog.cashdog.ChooseRecipient"
                    android:label="fragment_choose_recipient"
                    tools:layout="@layout/fragment_choose_recipient">
                    <action
                        android:id="@+id/action_chooseRecipient_to_chooseAmountFragment"
                        app:destination="@id/chooseAmountFragment" />
                </fragment>
                <fragment
                    android:id="@+id/chooseAmountFragment"
                    android:name="com.example.cashdog.cashdog.ChooseAmountFragment"
                    android:label="fragment_choose_amount"
                    tools:layout="@layout/fragment_choose_amount" />
            </navigation>
        </navigation>
```  
    
6.  In your code, pass the resource ID of the action connecting the root graph to the nested graph:
    
    ### Kotlin

```kotlin 
    view.findNavController().navigate(R.id.action_mainFragment_to_sendMoneyGraph)
```

### Java

```java    
    Navigation.findNavController(view).navigate(R.id.action_mainFragment_to_sendMoneyGraph);
```

7.  Back in the **Design** tab, you can return to the root graph by clicking **Root**.
    

Reference other navigation graphs with <include>
------------------------------------------------

Within a navigation graph, you can reference other graphs by using `include`. While this is functionally the same as using a nested graph, `include` lets you use graphs from other project modules or from library projects, as shown in the example below:

```xml
<!-- (root) nav_graph.xml -->
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<navigation xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
    xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
    android:id="@+id/nav_graph"
    app:startDestination="@id/fragment">

    <include app:graph="@navigation/included_graph" />

    <fragment
        android:id="@+id/fragment"
        android:name="com.example.myapplication.BlankFragment"
        android:label="Fragment in Root Graph"
        tools:layout="@layout/fragment_blank">
        <action
            android:id="@+id/action_fragment_to_second_graph"
            app:destination="@id/second_graph" />
    </fragment>

    ...
</navigation>

<!-- included_graph.xml -->
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<navigation xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
    xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
    android:id="@+id/second_graph"
    app:startDestination="@id/includedStart">

    <fragment
        android:id="@+id/includedStart"
        android:name="com.example.myapplication.IncludedStart"
        android:label="fragment_included_start"
        tools:layout="@layout/fragment_included_start" />
</navigation>
```
