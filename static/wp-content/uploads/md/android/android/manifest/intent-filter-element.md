`<data>` description: Specifies the types of intents that an activity, service, or broadcast receiver can respond to. An intent filter declares the capabilities of its parent component â€” what an activity or service can do and what types of broadcasts a receiver can handle. It opens the component to receiving intents of the advertised type, while filtering out those that are not meaningful for the component.

Most of the contents of the filter are described by its `<action>`, `<category>`, and `<data>` subelements.

For a more detailed discussion of filters, see the separate Intents and Intent Filters document, as well as the Intents Filters section in the introduction.

attributes: `android:icon` An icon that represents the parent activity, service, or broadcast receiver when that component is presented to the user as having the capability described by the filter.

This attribute must be set as a reference to a drawable resource containing the image definition. The default value is the icon set by the parent component's `icon` attribute. If the parent does not specify an icon, the default is the icon set by the `<application>` element.

For more on intent filter icons, see Icons and Labels in the introduction.

`android:label` A user-readable label for the parent component. This label, rather than the one set by the parent component, is used when the component is presented to the user as having the capability described by the filter.

The label should be set as a reference to a string resource, so that it can be localized like other strings in the user interface. However, as a convenience while you're developing the application, it can also be set as a raw string.

The default value is the label set by the parent component. If the parent does not specify a label, the default is the label set by the `<application>` element's `label` attribute.

For more on intent filter labels, see Icons and Labels in the introduction.

`android:priority` The priority that should be given to the parent component with regard to handling intents of the type described by the filter. This attribute has meaning for both activities and broadcast receivers:

*   It provides information about how able an activity is to respond to an intent that matches the filter, relative to other activities that could also respond to the intent. When an intent could be handled by multiple activities with different priorities, Android will consider only those with higher priority values as potential targets for the intent.
*   It controls the order in which broadcast receivers are executed to receive broadcast messages. Those with higher priority values are called before those with lower values. (The order applies only to synchronous messages; it's ignored for asynchronous messages.)


Use this attribute only if you really need to impose a specific order in which the broadcasts are received, or want to force Android to prefer one activity over others.

The value must be an integer, such as "`100`". Higher numbers have a higher priority. The default value is 0.

In certain circumstances the requested priority is ignored and the value is capped to `0`. This occurs when:

*   A non-privileged application requests any priority >0
*   A privileged application requests a priority >0 for `ACTION_VIEW`, `ACTION_SEND`, `ACTION_SENDTO` or `ACTION_SEND_MULTIPLE`

Also see `setPriority())`.

`android:order` The order in which the filter should be processed when multiple filters match.

`order` differs from `priority` in that `priority` applies across apps, while `order` disambiguates multiple matching filters in a single app.

When multiple filters could match, use a directed intent instead.

The value must be an integer, such as "`100`". Higher numbers are matched first. The default value is `0`.

This attribute was introduced in API Level 28.
