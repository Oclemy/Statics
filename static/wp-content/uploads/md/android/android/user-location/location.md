# Build location-aware apps

### Build location-aware apps

One of the unique features of mobile applications is location awareness. Mobile users take their devices with them everywhere, and adding location awareness to your app offers users a more contextual experience. The location APIs available in Google Play services facilitate adding location awareness to your app with automated location tracking, wrong-side-of-the-street detection, geofencing, and activity recognition.

### Optimize power usage

Improve the battery efficiency of your users' devices. Follow the guidelines related to background location limits.

### Add maps to your app

Plot locations of interest on a map, and give users control over what they see on the map.
