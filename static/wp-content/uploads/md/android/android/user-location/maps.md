The new Maps offer exciting features such as 3D maps; indoor, satellite, terrain, and hybrid maps; vector-based tiles for efficient caching and drawing; animated transitions; and much more. Add a map object.

#### Customize the map

Add markers onto the map to indicate special points of interest for your users. You can define custom colors or icons for your map markers to match your app's look and feel. To further enhance the app, draw polylines and polygons to indicate paths or regions, or provide complete image overlays. Draw markers.

#### Control the user's view

Give your users a different view of the world with the ability to control the rotation, tilt, zoom, and pan properties of the "camera" perspective of the map. Change the view.

#### Add Street View to your app

Embed Street View into an activity and let your users explore the world through panoramic 360-degree views. Programmatically control the zoom and orientation (tilt and bearing) of the Street View camera, and animate the camera movements over a given duration. Add Street View.
