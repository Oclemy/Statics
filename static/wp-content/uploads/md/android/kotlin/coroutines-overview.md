# Coroutines

Asynchronous or non-blocking programming is an important part of the development landscape. When creating server-side,
desktop, or mobile applications, it's important to provide an experience that is not only fluid from the user's perspective,
but also scalable when needed.

Kotlin solves this problem in a flexible way by providing [coroutine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroutine) support
at the language level and delegating most of the functionality to libraries.

In addition to opening the doors to asynchronous programming, coroutines also provide a wealth of other possibilities,
such as concurrency and actors.
