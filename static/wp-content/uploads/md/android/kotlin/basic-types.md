# Basic types

In Kotlin, everything is an object in the sense that you can call member functions and properties on any variable.
Some types can have a special internal representation – for example, numbers, characters and booleans can be
represented as primitive values at runtime – but to the user they look like ordinary classes. 

This section describes the basic types used in Kotlin:
* Numbers and their unsigned counterparts
* Booleans
* Characters
* Strings
* Arrays
