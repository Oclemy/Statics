# How the Community Operates



## Blitz is a Community Project ü§ù

Blitz [was initially started by Brandon Bayer](./community-history), but
from the very beginning it's always been a community project. 38 people
contributed to the very first alpha version!

All other contributors help in their free time. We now have
[over 350 total contributors](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz#contributors-)!

**Because Blitz is a community project, the entire community gets to help
shape Blitz and where it goes in the future.**

## Where to Ask Questions

First, search [the Blitz Discord](https://discord.blitzjs.com) and
[the GitHub repo](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz) to see if someone has
already asked your question.

Next,
[post your question in our Discussion Forum](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz/discussions).
This is much better than Discord as it's easier for people to find and
link to.

Then you're welcome to post a link to your Discussion thread in Discord,
because GitHub Discussions don't have a Discord notification integration
yet.

üôè As you gain experience with Blitz, please help answer other peoples
questions!

## How to Report a Bug

First,
[search existing GitHub issues](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz/issues?q=is%3Aissue)
so see if someone has already reported your issue.

If not, then please
[open a new issue](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz/issues/new/choose)!
Someone will usually reply to your new issue within a day or two.

If you want to report an issue for the legacy Blitz framework, please do
it in [this repository](https://github.com/blitz-js/legacy-framework).

## Roadmap

Currently the core team is working on getting the Blitz Toolkit to the
stable version, which mostly means smoothing rough edges and fixing bugs.
However, anyone else is more than welcome to continue adding major
features!

Our [GitHub issues](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz/issues) are where
you can find our roadmap. Many planned features have GitHub issues, but
not necessarily all of them do.

## How to Propose Features/Changes

We love ideas and suggestions for how to make Blitz better! But please
keep in mind we have a lot more feature ideas than contributor time to
make them all happen. So it'd be great if you can make a PR too!

### Minor Changes

For minor changes like adding a new CLI flag or something, simply
[open a new GitHub issue](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz/issues/new/choose).

### Everything Else: RFCs

For any other features, even as small as adding a single new React hook,
please post your request as an RFC (Request for Comments) as a
[GitHub Discussion Thread](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz/discussions/category_choices).

To post an RFC, do the following:

* Start the title with `[RFC]`
* Include the following sections
	+ `### What do you want and why?`
	+ `### How is this different from what you are currently doing?`
	+ `### Possible implementation(s)`
* After posting, please also share it in Discord in
`#request-for-comments`.

## Your Role

As a member of the Blitz community, we value your input, ideas,
suggestions, and help!

Please feel very welcome to comment on any GitHub issue, pull request,
RFC, etc! The community as a whole gets to shape where Blitz goes!

As you gain experience, we greatly appreciate your help including but not
limited to, answering people's questions, reviewing PRs, improving
documentation, submitting PRs, etc.

## How to Level Up in the Community

You can gain respect and influence in our community by being regularly
involved, being helpful, and being nice.

We have two official maintainer levels you can read about below, but you
are more than welcome to do the work of a maintainer before being
acknowledged as such. In fact doing the work of a maintainer is one of the
best ways to level up in the community.

Another great way to level up is by teaching people about Blitz and
helping them be successful Blitz developers. This can by blog posts,
videos, courses, etc.

## NPM Releases

Currently we have automated alpha releases for every commit to the `main``
barnch.

## Finances

[Flightcontrol](http://flightcontrol.dev/) is paying Aleksandra Sikora for
her Lead Maintainer role, and Dillon Raphael for his Senior Blitz.js
Maintainer role.

We also **really appreciate when companies who use Blitz pay their
employees** to contribute to Blitz, either part-time or full-time!

## Core Team

The Blitz core team consists of people who are deeply invested in Blitz.
The core team has GitHub, Discord, and npm admin permissions. People can
become core members by starting as a level 1 maintainer, becoming a level
2 maintainer, and then on to the core team.

## L2 Maintainers

Level 2 maintainers are the backbone of the community and are responsible
for reviewing and merging PRs. They are watchdogs over the code, ensuring
code quality, correctness, and security. They also help facilitate a rapid
pace of progress.

For more details, see [Being an L2 Maintainer](./maintainers)

## L1 Maintainers

Level 1 maintainers primarily help manage the community and triage issues.
They are critical for a healthy Blitz community. They take a lot of burden
off the core team and level 2 maintainers so they can focus on higher
level things with longer term impact.
