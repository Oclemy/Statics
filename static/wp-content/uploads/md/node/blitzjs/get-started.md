### Set Up Your Computer

You need Node.js 16 or newer. You can verify this by running `node -v` in
your terminal. If you don't have Node or need a newer version, we
recommend using a node version manager like
[fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm). That will allow you to change node
versions and even have different versions for each project.
