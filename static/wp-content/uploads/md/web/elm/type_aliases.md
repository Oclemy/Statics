# Type Aliases

Type annotations can start to get long. This might be a real problem if you have records with many fields! This is the core motivation for type aliases. A **type alias** is a shorter name for a type. For example, you could create a `User` alias like this:

```elm
type alias User =
  { name : String
  , age : Int
  }

```

Rather than writing the whole record type all the time, we can just say `User` instead. This helps us write type annotations that are easier to read:

```elm
-- WITH ALIAS

isOldEnoughToVote : User -> Bool
isOldEnoughToVote user =
  user.age >= 18

-- WITHOUT ALIAS

isOldEnoughToVote : { name : String, age : Int } -> Bool
isOldEnoughToVote user =
  user.age >= 18

```

These two definitions are equivalent, but the one with a type alias is shorter and easier to read. So all we are doing is making an **alias** for a long type.

## Models

It is extremely common to use type aliases when designing a model. When we were learning about The Elm Architecture, we saw a model like this:

```elm
type alias Model =
  { name : String
  , password : String
  , passwordAgain : String
  }

```

The main benefit of using a type alias for this is when we write the type annotations for the `update` and `view` functions. Writing `Msg -> Model -> Model` is so much nicer than the fully expanded version! It has the added benefit that we can add fields to our model without needing to change any type annotations.

## Record Constructors

When you create a type alias specifically for a record, it also generates a **record constructor**. So if we define a `User` type alias, we can start building records like this:

```shell

> type alias User = { name : String, age : Int }
> User
<function> : String -> Int -> User
> User "Sue" 58
{ name = "Sue", age = 58 } : User
> User "Tom" 31
{ name = "Tom", age = 31 } : User

>
```
Try creating another user or creating a type alias of your own ⬆️

Note that the order of arguments in the record constructor match the order of fields in the type alias!

And again, **this is only for records.** Making type aliases for other types will not result in a constructor.
